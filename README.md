# Hugo Module TND Socials

## Requirements

Requirements:
- Go 1.14
- Hugo 0.61.0


## Installation

If not already, [init](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/#initialize-a-new-module) your project as Hugo Module:

```
$: hugo mod init {repo_url}
```

Configure your project's module to import this module:

```yaml
# config.yaml
module:
  imports:
  - path: github.com/theNewDynamic/hugo-module-tnd-socials
```

## Usage

### GetSocials

Module provides one partial called `GetSocials` which returns every or some Social services set in the project through the Module's [configuration](#configuration).

Returned services are maps structured as the following:
  - String (.Name)
  - String (.Handle)
  - String (.URL)
  - SVG (String of safe HTML)

If the given partial receives a `.Page` key with a Page object as value among its context, each service will sport an extra key:
  - String (.ShareURL)

#### Default "Follow Us" links

To simply print links pointing to the project's Social landing pages:

```
{{ range partialCached "tnd-socials/GetSocials" "GetSocials" }}
  <a href="{{ .URL }}" title="Follow {{ .Handle }} on {{ .Service }}">
    {{ .SVG }}
  </a>
{{ end }}
```
By default, the partial will return all the services set though the module's configuration in their original order. 
To limit or reorder services, the partial can take a `slice` as context:
```
{{ range partial "tnd-socials/GetSocials" (slice "facebook "twitter") }}
[...]
{{ end }}
```

##### "Share On.." links

The partial can also return a `.ShareURL` key for each services if it receives a `.Page` key among its context. The value is a share URL for the given services.
(Ex: `https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://example.com/that-article`) 

Chosen services discussed above will be hold in a `services` key.

```
{{ range partial "tnd-socials/GetSocials" (dict "Page" $ "services" (slice "facebook" "twitter")) }}
  <a href="{{ .ShareURL }}" title="Share on {{ .Service }}">
    {{ .SVG }}
  </a>
{{ end }}
```

Services sporting a ShareURL are for now:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Email

### Icons

Icons are pulled from a default [set](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/hugo-module-tnd-icons/tree/master/svgs) but can easily be overwritten by adding svg files to your projects using the following naming convention:

`assets/tnd-socials/{service|icon}.svg`

## Configure

The module can read Hugo's default `Social` settings but we recommand using the module's own `.Params.tnd_socials` reserved key for more control:

### Services
The `services` key takes a slice of Maps with the following keys:
  - __service*__: The name of the service
  - __handle*__: The username or handle of the service's profile. Use an email address for the `email` service.
  - __url__: If the profile URL does not follow the conventional `https://www.{service}.com/{handle}` it should be set here.
  - __icon__: Icon file's basename (no extension). Available icons are [here](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/hugo-module-tnd-icons/tree/master/svgs)  

```yaml
# config.yaml
params:
  tnd_socials:
